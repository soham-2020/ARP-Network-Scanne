Overview

NetSense is a comprehensive Python-based Network Monitoring and Security Toolkit that integrates real-time device scanning, network simulation, and machine learning-based packet analysis.
It‚Äôs designed for cybersecurity researchers, IoT testers, and network administrators to study traffic patterns, detect anomalies, and simulate device behavior in a safe environment.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic ARP Network Scanner

Uses Scapy to perform real-time device discovery within the local subnet.

Displays IP, MAC, Vendor, and Hostname using the OUI database and reverse DNS lookup.

Auto-detects local IP and subnet range dynamically.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Mock Network Simulator

Simulates real-world device behavior with random connections, disconnections, and failed Wi-Fi attempts.

Logs every network event with timestamps for behavioral analysis.

Ideal for testing alert and monitoring systems safely.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning-Based Packet Classifier

Captures live network packets using Scapy‚Äôs sniff() function.

Extracts packet features (Length, Protocol) and labels them for anomaly detection.

Trains a Random Forest classifier to distinguish between normal and suspicious packets.

Outputs a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
